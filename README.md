# "Random word generator" - Twitterbot

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
The random word generator runs on Python 3.6, so you need to install Python first. A good tutorial of this may be found [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download). Also needed is a [Twitter account](https://www.twitter.com) and [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/) for Python.
### Installing
First you need to move the files "adjectives.txt" and "nouns.txt" to the same location as "bot.py". After downloading and installing Python you need to install Tweepy next. After this you need to create a Twitter App, from which you then need your credentials for the public and private keys, to fill into the script.
### Usage
After filling in your Twitter credentials you just need to run the script and you will find the Tweets appear.
